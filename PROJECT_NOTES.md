# PROJECT NOTES

## Document:
    ### What you learned about the codebase?
    - The "Duke & Chord Music" application is a full-stack web application that serves as both a musical instrument marketplace and a music education platform.
    - **Purpose**: To provide a single-page application (SPA) experience where users can browse and sell musical instruments, preview audio samples, discover and enroll in music classes, and manage their user accounts.
    - **Audience**: Musicians looking to buy or sell instruments, students interested in music classes, and individuals exploring instruments through audio previews.
    - **Main Features**:
        - User Authentication (secure registration and login).
        - Instrument Marketplace (browsing, detailed views, selling, filtering, audio previews).
        - Music Classes (browsing, viewing details).
        - Employee Directory.

## Key Questions to Answer:

    - How did using an agentic AI tool compare to working alone?

    Using an agentic AI tool, helped me speed up development, learning and understanding.

    - What was surprising about how the AI understood the code?

    It was surpising how well AI could document the code analysis and explain it in an easy meaningful way.

    - Where did you need to correct or refine AI suggestions?

    Sometimes I would need to specify the more recent supported versions of certain frameworks, libraries, etc.

    - How did you verify AI-generated code was correct?

    The best way was to only generate code one small step at a time to verify the code and confirm that I understood each step. It was also helpful to have AI help generate unit tests to run after each step.

## Document:
    ### What you learned about the codebase?
    - The "Duke & Chord Music" application is a full-stack web application that serves as both a musical instrument marketplace and a music education platform.

    - **Audience**: Musicians looking to buy or sell instruments, students interested in music classes, and individuals exploring instruments through audio previews.
    - **Main Features**:
        - User Authentication (secure registration and login).
        - Instrument Marketplace (browsing, detailed views, selling, filtering, audio previews).
        - Music Classes (browsing, viewing details).
        - Employee Directory.
